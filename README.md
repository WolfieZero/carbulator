# Carbulator

A carbohydrate and insulin therapy calculator

## Background

I'm a [type 1 diabetic][1], as well as injecting myself with insulin daily I
have to calculate everything I eat. I have to look at the food I have an suss
out pretty accurately the weight of carbohydrates in food to then understand how
much insluin I need to inject myself. I also suck at mental arithmetic!

With the Carbulator I want a super quick way of adding up the total weight of
carbs in a meal along with a guide on how much insulin I may need. I also want
to quickly work out the weight in-front of me against the carb weight against
100g (that food legally have to display in the UK at least).

There are apps that do this, including my glucose manager, [mySugr][2]. but this
doesn't add it up for me, nor work out the ratio of 100g:Xg of food. It's also
strict and requires me give it a blood reading before working it out for me.

I'm not perfect, I don't always do blood glucose readings but I still want that
guidance. So this little PWA thing is there to help with that. Quickly add all
the different carbohydrate weights together and give me a rough guide on what
amount of insluin I should give based on my personal insulin therapy.
